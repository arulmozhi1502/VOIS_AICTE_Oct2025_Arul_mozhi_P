Analysis on Airbnb Dataset

Project Title -  "Analyzing Airbnb Content Trends for Strategic Insights and Market Optimization

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Airbnb hosts and business strategists face challenges in identifying the key factors that drive listing success, pricing dynamics, and guest satisfaction. With thousands of listings spread across various neighborhoods and property types, it becomes difficult to:

  -- Understand which areas and room types yield the best returns.
  
  -- Identify the relationship between price, service fees, and availability.
  
  -- Determine how host verification and property construction year influence customer ratings.
  
This project seeks to solve these problems by analyzing Airbnb’s dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize key trends that support smarter decision-making in property listing, pricing, and quality assurance.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTIOIN
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Airbnb’s open dataset to uncover content trends that influence pricing, property availability, host performance, and customer engagement. The study focuses on understanding how neighborhood groups, room types, construction years, and host verification statuses affect overall listing behavior and user reviews.

Through comprehensive data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, the project reveals patterns in Airbnb listings — such as the most common property types, average neighborhood prices, and correlations between service fees and listing costs. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support strategic business recommendations for Airbnb and similar platforms.
